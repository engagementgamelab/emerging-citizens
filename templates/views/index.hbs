      <!-- <h2>#You're It</h2>
      <p>Hash Tag Youâ€™re It is a fun bluffing game where players need to use convincing rhetorical language to craft tweets using real hashtag campaigns. By manipulating hashtags and exploring their meanings, students will learn about real hashtag campaigns for marketing or activism (their context, structure, and purpose) and how to rhetorically craft a 140 character limited statement to effectively convey the message of the campaign, or subvert it for a new purpose.</p>

      <p>Based on the popular NPR game show Wait, Wait Don't Tell Me, Wait, Wait Don't Tell MEME is a investigative bluffing game that teaches players how to quickly fact check image based viral content. This game puts students in the role of conversation-shapers by tasking them to create memes about cultural and political issues through playful acts of creation. They will then learn to parse content for media messages, intent, and impact by ranking the created memes by various measures including political spectrum, tone, intention, and "truthfulness."</p>
